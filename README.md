## Overview

Building Stats-Preview-Card-Component required basic HTML, CSS and flexbox knowledge. It is a great project for newbie like me. 

### The challenge

It took me one week to complete this project. The challenges I faced mostly in CSS section, thinking of how to allocate the 'width' and 'height' with different units. I found it hard to understand the concept. I am also having hard time dealing with <img>, especially with overlaying color on an image.
